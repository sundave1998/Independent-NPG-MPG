## **Provably Fast Convergence of Independent Natural Policy Gradient for Markov Potential Games**
[*Code for ''Provably Fast Convergence of Independent Natural Policy Gradient for Markov Potential Games'' (NeurIPS 2023)*](https://arxiv.org/abs/TBD)


### Prerequisites
Here we list our running environment:
- PyTorch == 1.10.0
- docplex == 2.18.200
- numpy == 1.19.2
- matplotlib == 3.4.3


### Tasks
We implement our proposed algorithms in the following environments:
- General Markov Potential Games (oracle)
- Congestion Game (oracle)


### Execution
To run the experiments, simply execute the following commands, where ''xxx'' corresponds to the name of files.
```
python xxx.py
```

### Credits
The code in this repository is adapted from the following works
